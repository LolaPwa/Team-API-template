# Team API template

A template for defining a Team API. A Team API is a description and specification that a team can define that tells others how to interact with that team.

Based on some of the ideas in the book _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable). See pages 47-49 of the book _Team Topologies_.
